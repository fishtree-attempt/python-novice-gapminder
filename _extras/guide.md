## General Notes

It's all right not to get through the whole lesson.
:   This lesson is designed for people who have never programmed before,
    but any given class may include people with a wide range of prior experience.
    We have therefore included enough material to fill a full day if need be,
    but expect that many offerings will only get as far as the introduction to Pandas.

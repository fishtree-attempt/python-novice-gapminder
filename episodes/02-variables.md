> Draw a table showing the values of the variables in this program
> after each statement is executed.
> In simple terms, what do the last three lines of this program do?

> ~~~
> lowest = 1.0
> highest = 3.0
> temp = lowest
> lowest = highest
> highest = temp

> ## Predicting Values
> 
> What is the final value of `position` in the program below?
> (Try to predict the value without running the program,
> then check your prediction.)
> 
> ~~~
> initial = "left"
> position = initial
> initial = "right"

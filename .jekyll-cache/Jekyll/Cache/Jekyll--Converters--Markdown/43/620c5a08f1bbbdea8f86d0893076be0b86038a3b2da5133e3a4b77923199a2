<p>Over break, reflect on and discuss the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A common refrain in software engineering is “Don’t Repeat Yourself”. How do the techniques we’ve learned in the last
lessons help us avoid repeating ourselves? <em>note that in practice there is some nuance to this and should be balanced
with doing the simplest thing that could possibly work</em></li>
  <li>What are the pros / cons of making a variable global or local to a function?</li>
  <li>When would you consider turning a block of code into a function definition?</li>
</ul>

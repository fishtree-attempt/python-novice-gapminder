<ul>
  <li>What sort of packages might you use in Python and why would you use them?</li>
  <li>How would data need to be formatted to be used in Pandas data frames? Would the data you have meet these requirements?</li>
  <li>What limitations or problems might you run into when thinking about how to apply what weâ€™ve learned to your own projects or data?</li>
</ul>

This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python 3 for people with little or no previous
programming experience. It uses plotting as its motivating example and is designed to be used in
both [Data Carpentry][dc-lessons] and [Software Carpentry][swc-lessons] workshops.
This lesson references [JupyterLab][jupyterlab] but can be taught using alternative Python 3 interpreters
as well (e.g., repl.it, Anaconda).

## Prerequisites

1. Learners need to understand what files and directories are,
  what a working directory is,
  and how to start a Python interpreter.

2. Learners must install Python 3 before the class starts.

3. Learners must get the gapminder data before class starts:
  please download and unzip the file

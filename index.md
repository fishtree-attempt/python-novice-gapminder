This lesson is an introduction to programming Python
for people with little or no previous programming experience
using analysis of tabular data as a motivating example.
It is designed to be used in both [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }})
and [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops.
This lesson references the Jupyter Notebook,
but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter as well.
Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.

>

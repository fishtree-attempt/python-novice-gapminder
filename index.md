This lesson is an introduction to programming Python for people with little or no previous programming experience.
It is designed to be used in both [Data Carpentry][dc-website] and [Software Carpentry][swc-website] workshops,
and to serve as a worked example in [instructor training][instructor-training] of how to develop a new lesson.
